        \begin{itemize}
        \item <1-> The thesis explored OSR on a dataset composed of SEM images of wafer defects.
        \item <2-> We presented a method based on Mahalanobis distance to detect novelties, which achieved modest results.
        \item <3-> We tested the RPL framework applied to the dataset, found in literature.
        \item <4-> It showed promising results: AUC ranging in $[0.81, 0.91]$.
        \item <5-> Openness is not a good measure for the difficulty of the OSR task.
        \item <6-> Future directions include improving the organization of the dataset and exploring other possibilities, such as ARPL or Siamese Neural Networks.
        \end{itemize}
