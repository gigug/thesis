        \begin{itemize}
        \item <1-> The thesis explored OSR on a dataset composed of SEM images of wafer defects.
        \item <2-> A method based on Mahalanobis distance to detect novelties has been presented, which achieved modest results.
        \item <3-> The RPL framework, found in literature, has been tested and showed more promising results.
        \item <4-> Openness is not a good measure for the difficulty of the OSR task.
        \item <5-> Future directions include improving the organization of the dataset and exploring other possibilities, such as ARPL or Siamese Neural Networks.
        \end{itemize}
